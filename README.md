# Tracey Raytracer

Tracey is a basic raytracer with accelerated rendering using openMP parallelism and BVH-based object container. A GUI control with a user-oriented material/object palette is provided for free rendering. To use Tracey, simply execute the compiled binary, or use the powershell command under main.cpp to build the project.
